STL files

There are no need for supports, recommended settings are 4 perimeters/top/bottom, 13% infill.
All the files are ready to print, they are on the recommended orientation.

- Version 0.1 - initial release
- Version 0.2 - Revised probe and dock to improve the docking fit, remaining components are compatible
  - Thanks to oc_geek for improving the probing of a badly tilted gantry (10ยบ) and the probe and dock attachment, it's much better now
