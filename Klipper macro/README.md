If using the physical Z endstop please remember to comment out the Homming overide from your printer.cfg.
For using the Klicky probe as a probe only (no Z endstop) it is not necessary to remove anything from your existent configuration.

You may have a faster PRINT_START if you use Attach_Probe_Lock at the beggining and Dock_Probe_Unlock at the end.
