This is a modified Klicky probe with two holes so that you can feed through the uninsolated part of the cable a little bit more.
Gave me better contact

![## KlickyVoron 2.4 Direct Mount MGN12 X Carriage](./bluedragonx/)

This is a modified MGN12 X carriage for the Voron 2.4 which directly interfaces
with the Klicky. This is based on ![Arkeet's MGN12 carriage](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/arkeet/mgn12)
!!Notice!!
The carriage needs to be updated to fix the magnet position for Hall effect endstop, works fine if not using it

![## More Roboust Klicky Probe](./oc_geek/)

Beefier column and revised holes for zip tie (was def too small); reduced height 1mm (was excess)
Chanfered bottom in all direction (also sides) on the probe carriage
Microswitch body exposed by a tiny bit

![## Klicky dock mount for Legacy](./oc_geek/)
