This mod includes an MGN12 X carriage for the Voron 2.4 that directly
integrates the Klicky mount. This is based on [Arkeet's MGN12 carriage][1].

You will need to print both left and right halfs and install the magnets and
wiring as you would the regular Klicky mount.

The Klicky probe sits higher on the carriage with this mod. The standard fixed
docks will not work. You will need to print either the updated fixed mount or
updated side mount depending on your desired dock position.
