This mod includes an MGN12 X carriage for the Voron 2.4 that directly
integrates the Klicky mount. This is based on [Arkeet's MGN12 carriage][1].

You will need to print both left and right halfs and install the magnets and
wiring as you would the regular Klicky mount. This mount sits higher up so the
standard fixed dock will not work with this mod. An adjusted fixed mount is
coming in the future.
